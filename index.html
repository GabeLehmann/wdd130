            <p>My name is Gabe Lehmann.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm taking classes for a Computer Science degree.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include music, video games (I like Smash Bros.), movies, skating, drawing, cooking, and
                shopping.</p>
            <p>I'm not married or in any relationship right now.</p>
            <p>I hope that this class will allow me to better my skills in web design.</p>
            <p>There are lots of careers and opportunities that can come from the skills I will learn in this class, and
                I'm hoping that it may help me find a stable job and career for the future.</p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints my whole life.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite scriptures is "Matthew 22:37-39".</p>
            <p>If anyone wants to get to know me a little better, here are my socials:</p>
