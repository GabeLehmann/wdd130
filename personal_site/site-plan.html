      <p>Heyo!</p>
      <p>I'm Gabe! A University student based in Rexburg, Idaho. I love music, video games, movies, skating, and drawing.

        I'm really into computers. Right now, I'm on track for a computer science degree, taking programming, web design, and computer system classes to learn all about what makes the things I love tick.
        
        I dabble in many creative areas, but I have a particular love for drawing, playing the piano, and making music on my laptop.
        
        Most of my creative stuff has been submitted to several different contests and shows. I've submitted music for numerous competitions in high school, such as BPA, TSA, and Battle Cup, as well as other freelance beat contests.
        
        My music has not been publicly released yet, but will and can be found on Spotify. I also post my art and music to Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

<p>Like What You See?
I started drawing at a pretty young age, and I’m still drawing to this very day. This is a compilation of various drawings and artwork I’ve done over the years. The images you see are what I consider to be my best pieces in media. Of course, not all of my art is here (a lot of it isn’t very good), but these are my overall favorites that I thought deserved to be shared.

<p>Like What You Hear?
  I started making music since the beginning of 2020. Since I’ve started, I’ve been having a blast writing and composing for years and years. I’m no professional, but the music listed is some of my favorite pieces that I’ve written so far. Making music is just something I really love and enjoy, so I’m going to continue to do it and do my best to get better and better.</p>
